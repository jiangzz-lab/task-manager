plan before taking actions

note the lesson learned after a problem shows up and is solved

you can test the scripts and install the dependencies by running commands in terminal

no need to wait for the user's approval unless the action envolves deleting files

# Lessons Learned
1. When setting up a Vite application, make sure to include an index.html file in the root directory of the project. This file is essential for Vite to serve the application correctly.

2. When working with SQLite databases in Docker containers, be careful with volume mappings. If a database file is mounted as a volume and the file doesn't exist, Docker might create a directory instead of a file, causing database connection errors.

3. Using named volumes for database files in Docker is more reliable than direct file mounting, especially for SQLite databases.

4. Entrypoint scripts are valuable for handling file system conflicts in Docker containers. They can check for and fix issues before the application starts.

5. Always check container logs when troubleshooting Docker-related issues. They provide valuable information about what's happening inside the container.

6. When adding new categories or options to a schema, remember to update both the backend (schemas) and frontend (components) to maintain consistency.

7. When preparing a project for GitHub, create a comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude sensitive information, environment files, and unnecessary development artifacts.

8. For React applications using Material UI, ensure that category options are consistently defined across components to maintain a unified user experience.

9. Docker volume management is critical for data persistence. Ensure that database files are properly persisted using appropriate volume configurations.

10. When troubleshooting database connection issues, simplify the database URL path to reduce potential permission or path resolution problems.

11. When testing API endpoints in Windows PowerShell, use the Swagger UI (available at http://localhost:8000/docs for FastAPI) instead of curl commands, as PowerShell may have issues with curl syntax and execution.

12. When implementing drag-and-drop functionality in React, use modern libraries like @dnd-kit that are compatible with the latest React versions. Be aware that some older libraries like react-beautiful-dnd may have compatibility issues with newer React versions.

13. When installing npm packages in a Docker container, add them to the Dockerfile rather than just installing them locally. This ensures the packages are available when the container is rebuilt.

14. For drag-and-drop interfaces, make the entire item draggable rather than just a handle for better user experience and intuitive interaction.

15. When implementing priority-based sorting with drag-and-drop, ensure that all affected items have their priorities updated, not just the dragged item. This maintains consistent ordering across page refreshes.

16. When working with IDs in JavaScript, be mindful of type conversions. String IDs from DOM elements may need to be converted to integers for database operations.
